# MatLab-Mandelbrot-set-zoom-video
Coded and rendered a video zooming into and spanning the mathematical beauty of the Mandelbrot set using Matlab.
The Mandelbrot function was used to calculate the number of iterations before diverging for specific sections on
a complex 2D plane. The sections of the plane were assigned a colour based on the number of iterations before
diverging which would become pixels for the video. Zooms and translations around the Mandelbrot set were
calculated by shifting the sections of space on the 2D plane.   Fade transitions, rotations, and music were
added using Adobe premier in post production.
